# Greetings

This is an example of implementing:

1. A [controller](./controller.go) (with a `Reconciler` and `Validator`)
2. An [actor](./actor.go)
3. A [portal](./portal.go).

> [!WARNING]
> The greetings extension currently does not have a portal endpoint (i.e. no http/nats service to return HTML). So there is nothing to browse in the UI.
