    This talk dives into the details of how NATS JetStream's Key/Value buckets work, and showcases how easy it is to move and replicate data without having to change your applications.

## Platform Engineering

1. [Build Abstractions not Illusions - Gregor Hohpe - YOW! 2023](https://youtu.be/aWZFRk-w3ng?si=aM8CGTLnI8Jm41Bt)

    Abstract:
    Let’s be honest, the tech we have today is amazing but it can also be complex. So, it’s only natural that the platforms we build want to hide that complexity to improve productivity, avoid mistakes, and reduce cognitive load. So, the more complexity we can hide, the better our platform?
    Actually no - we need to be careful that we create useful abstractions, not dangerous illusions.
    This talk reflects on two decades of building complex distributed systems, highlighting where abstractions helped and where illusions led to major disappointments.
