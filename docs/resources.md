## Learning NATS

1. [Synadia - The coolest OSS project you've never heard of: NATS Getting started!](https://youtu.be/hjXIUPZ7ArM?si=-2nazkTI3OTHprUz)
    NATS is a connective technology powering modern distributed systems, unifying Cloud, On-Premise, Edge, and IoT.

2. [Synadia - JetStream KV: A fascinating alternative to Redis](https://youtu.be/XLJ5_5MsgGQ?si=7OQuxbUXW1QGwKSi)

    This talk dives into the details of how NATS JetStream's Key/Value buckets work, and showcases how easy it is to move and replicate data without having to change your applications.

## Platform Engineering

1. [YOW! 2023 - Build Abstractions not Illusions - Gregor Hohpe](https://youtu.be/aWZFRk-w3ng?si=aM8CGTLnI8Jm41Bt)

    Let’s be honest, the tech we have today is amazing but it can also be complex. So, it’s only natural that the platforms we build want to hide that complexity to improve productivity, avoid mistakes, and reduce cognitive load. So, the more complexity we can hide, the better our platform?
    Actually no - we need to be careful that we create useful abstractions, not dangerous illusions.
    This talk reflects on two decades of building complex distributed systems, highlighting where abstractions helped and where illusions led to major disappointments.

2. [DevOps Toolkit - Developer Platform Consoles Should Be Dumb](https://youtu.be/Qy2QmJkwkP0?si=3dnYcPx0BjOX-e5Y)

    We dive deep into the world of developer platform consoles, exploring the importance of simplicity, API-based architectures, and the crucial role these elements play in discoverability, operations, and observability. We argue that developer platform consoles should aim for a 'dumb' design philosophy - one that emphasizes straightforward interfaces and leverages APIs to interact with underlying services and data. By stripping down the complexity traditionally found in these consoles, developers can achieve greater efficiency and enhance the maintainability of their systems.
