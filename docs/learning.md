## Learning NATS

1. [Synadia - The coolest OSS project you've never heard of: NATS Getting started!](https://youtu.be/hjXIUPZ7ArM?si=-2nazkTI3OTHprUz)
    NATS is a connective technology powering modern distributed systems, unifying Cloud, On-Premise, Edge, and IoT.

2. [Synadia - JetStream KV: A fascinating alternative to Redis](https://youtu.be/XLJ5_5MsgGQ?si=7OQuxbUXW1QGwKSi)

    This talk dives into the details of how NATS JetStream's Key/Value buckets work, and showcases how easy it is to move and replicate data without having to change your applications.

## Platform Engineering

1. [YOW! 2023 - Build Abstractions not Illusions - Gregor Hohpe](https://youtu.be/aWZFRk-w3ng?si=aM8CGTLnI8Jm41Bt)

    Let’s be honest, the tech we have today is amazing but it can also be complex. So, it’s only natural that the platforms we build want to hide that complexity to improve productivity, avoid mistakes, and reduce cognitive load. So, the more complexity we can hide, the better our platform?
    Actually no - we need to be careful that we create useful abstractions, not dangerous illusions.
    This talk reflects on two decades of building complex distributed systems, highlighting where abstractions helped and where illusions led to major disappointments.

2. [DevOps Toolkit - Developer Platform Consoles Should Be Dumb](https://youtu.be/Qy2QmJkwkP0?si=3dnYcPx0BjOX-e5Y)

    We dive deep into the world of developer platform consoles, exploring the importance of simplicity, API-based architectures, and the crucial role these elements play in discoverability, operations, and observability. We argue that developer platform consoles should aim for a 'dumb' design philosophy - one that emphasizes straightforward interfaces and leverages APIs to interact with underlying services and data. By stripping down the complexity traditionally found in these consoles, developers can achieve greater efficiency and enhance the maintainability of their systems.

3. [From toolbox to platform product your developers love - Henrik Høegh](https://youtu.be/m8-O7yEWoE8?si=oDS9Br5KnqrzBeFV)

    Building a platform is not a "let's install many awesome tools" exercise. Presenting developers with these toolboxes only increases the mental load. We need to take DevOps to the next level by creating tools our developers love to use and hide all the tools they don't care about. But how do you hide Kubernetes, GitHub actions, etc., and how do your developers release software?

4. [Tips For Building Successful Platform Teams - Dave Farley](https://youtu.be/_zH7TIXcjEs?si=cBGYeUI9rMl3GW3d)

    What is a platform team, and how do you build effective platforms? Platforms are often an important part of the strategy to scale software development beyond small single teams. Dividing work up so that common behaviours and services can be shared, rather than every service team implementing their own version, is a big gain, but it can also be a big cost. Coupling between teams is one of the biggest causes of problems when trying to build software on larger scales.
