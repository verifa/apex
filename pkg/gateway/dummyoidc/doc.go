// Package dummyoidc provides a dummy OIDC server/provider for dev and testing
// purposes.
//
// It is pretty much a copy+paste from the zitadel/oidc repository examples:
//
//	https://github.com/zitadel/oidc/tree/main/example/server
//
// It has a few modifications, such as allowing us to pass in a list of users.
// Other than that, I suggest you look at the zitadel/oidc repository for more
// information.
